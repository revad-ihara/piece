46|||description|||2011-05-20 14:17:46|||1000020|||Completion: Ignore non identifiers when matching proposals  Since now we reduced the idle editor time for showing completions, some things started to be a bit annoying. This fix changes the prefix from the proposal to include only letters, digits, and the underscore. Yes, technically they are not allways identifiers in a generic sense, but it should be enough for our purpose.  Now, you should not receive a proposal foo: when you have already typed foo in QML, for example.  Change-Id: Ica92182a34636598faedb067d0527e37ca6fee89

153|||description|||2011-05-26 16:11:20|||1000093|||sockets: limit buffer size of the internal sockets in proxy engines  The application can normally control the amount of buffering of a socket or QNetworkReply by using the setReadBufferSize API. This allows the application to flow control the TCP connection, and avoids out of memory errors when the data being downloaded is received faster than the application can process it.  However when using a proxy, the proxy socket engine has an internal socket which is used to communicate with the proxy server. It is not visible to the user, and does not have awareness of the buffer size of the external socket.  To solve this, we limit the internal sockets buffer size to 64k bytes. Under normal operation, the data is swiftly copied to the external socket where the buffer can grow (or not) based on the applications set value for read buffer size.

232|||description|||2011-05-30 14:15:44|||1000086|||Implemented module-local caching of module profiles.  We use syncqt to generate .qmake.cache also for submodules, which contains the location of forwarding module profiles for that module. This enables us to build without having to put module profiles into mkspecs/modules until install time.  Also added support for -developer-build to syncqt.  What it does is to point build directories for binaries and libraries to a common location in QtBase. This is more convenient when doing development, since you dont need to set your path to every modules bin/ directory, but it cannot be used with release builds, since they need to build independently of QtBase, in their own directory.

333|||description|||2011-06-06 11:41:59|||1000055|||Allow selecting fonts with irregular style names  Fonts like "Helvetica Neue UltraLight" or "Skia Regular Black Condensed" cant be selected in Qt because either they dont report correct numeric values for weight/stretch/etc. or these values are not mapped from QFont enums in a linear way. Thus we provide a shortcut to select these fonts with PostScript name or full name without resorting to family name matching in QFontDatabase (these fonts are not registered in font database anyway). After this, we can simply use:      QFont font("Helvetica Neue");     font.setStyleName("UltraLight");  to select these fonts. QCoreTextFontEngineMulti matched like this can be created directly from the CTFontRef instance instead of creating from the font name, making this process faster.  The commit also cleaned up the font loading process in Mac font database a bit, moving the code for family matching into a separate function.  Add QFontInfo::styleName() and QRawFont::styleName() to access the resolved style name for a font.  Task-number: QTBUG-19366 Change-Id: Iad07768c02ed06cc8d6b7395dec554384f410506

342|||description|||2011-06-07 07:22:31|||1000132|||Add function QGlyphRun::setRawData()  To provide an optimized way of constructing QGlyphRun objects with no copying or allocation, we add function setRawData() (naming inspired by QByteArray::setRawData()). Data retrieved from QRawFont can be passed directly into this. The logic is now that the data pointers in QGlyphRunPrivate should always point to the current valid data and is what will be used in comparisons and drawing calls. The vectors are optimizations to avoid unnecessary copying if the user wants to use the QVector based API (which makes it easier to manage the memory.) This reflected in the functions that return QVectors, which will return the stored vector if and only if it is identical to the current pointer. Otherwise we will have to copy the memory.  The internal addition operators in QGlyphRun have been removed since they really provide no real optimization and have an unclear definition if the two glyph runs are based on different fonts.

421|||description|||2011-06-09 12:23:12|||1000093|||IPv4 + IPv6 dual stack sockets  Adds support for binding "dual stack" sockets (via QUdpSocket or QTcpServer). A dual stack socket will accept incoming connections on either IPv4 or IPv6 interfaces.  QHostAddress::Any     - use this to bind a dual stack socket QHostAddress::AnyIPv6 - use this to bind a socket for IPv6 only QHostAddress::AnyIPv4 - use this to bind a socket for IPv4 only  Binding to a specific address rather than one of the "any" addresses is restricting you to a protocol anyway so no behaviour change there. IPv6 sockets were previously dual stack on some OS and v6 only on others Any previously meant IPv4 only  This commit implemented & tested on Windows 7, Linux (Ubuntu 10.04) and Mac OS 10.6.7.  Windows XP and server 2003 do not support dual stack sockets, even though they can support IPv6. On those versions, QHostAddress::Any will still bind to IPv4 0.0.0.0 (which is also the behaviour anywhere QT_NO_IPV6 is defined)  Autotests run: qudpsocket (includes a new test case) qtcpserver (includes a new test case) qtcpsocket qnetworkreply qhostaddress  Task-number: QTBUG-17080 Change-Id: Id486677c4f832e18dc0ff1a86c5f5fc422c9eb4f

445|||description|||2011-06-10 08:51:20|||1000132|||Fix missing empty lines in Qt HTML when displayed in compliant browsers  When QTextDocument exports HTML, it makes an effort to be compatible with its own importer, hence it has to be compatible with the dialect of HTML which Qt has developed over the years. One incorrect interpretation in Qt is that an empty paragraph is interpreted as an empty line. So if you use a QTextDocument to produce HTML for text where an empty line has been added, this empty line will not be visible when the document is viewed in a compliant browser. The fix is to set the height of the empty paragraph to 1em, so that it will match the current pixel size of the font, thus look the same as a <p><br /></p> but without altering the structure of the document.

Handle selection offer globals properly even if they arrive during the initial blocking read. If such a global arrives so early, the platform integration is not yet available from QApplicationPrivate (as it is just being constructed). Therefore the handling of the selection offer has to be delayed. At the moment selection offers are typically posted as globals and not added to the global list, but that is likely to change in the future.  Change-Id: Ib4ae804ad7f19e05978ee08828b88e028a3bf7b2

So thats the right place, except for us the debugger also depends on the toolchain. Switching the debugger thus involves reconfiguring.  Also due to the cmake cache in most cases reconfiguring with a different toolchain selected wont do anything.  Cmake and creators concept of toolchains clash.

It seems that usability is better when upon a perfect match the completion popup stays when triggered either explicitly or by an activation character. After all, in general one should need to type something else (semicolon, parenthesis, etc.) anyway for the case of an activation character.  This is also consistent with the behavior from previous releases.  Change-Id: I1d50230affb1d0642f8f8bfd5cbac69dc52e44bd

549|||description|||2011-06-21 12:07:19|||1000063|||Dont attempt to build benchmarks if release-mode Qt is not available  All of the benchmarks explicitly turn on release mode.  This fails on Mac and Windows if Qt is configured as debug-only.  It is also possibly misleading on Linux, as compiling the benchmark in release mode does not imply that Qt is compiled in release mode.  The results are generally not useful if release mode Qt is not available, so disable them by default in this case.  Change-Id: Ifa2bb6ab6412dd360ff9dfb890ace2f51e0eef86

For instance, in QML we dont want to preserve the popup if completion was triggered by an activation sequence. On the other hand, this is ok for C++ since a semicolon or parenthesis will in general still be typed (in some cases even with the intention to take advantage of the automatic bracked insertion).

Actually, it means 0 :)  This was not picked up for a while in testing because:    - we use this script with qtestlib tests, which dont close stdout     until they exit    - our tests for testrunner used e.g. /bin/true as a test command,     which does close file descriptors and can theoretically show up     the problem, but the command is run so fast that it usually exits     before it can receive SIGTERM.  This bug made the testrunner autotests (slightly) unstable.  Change-Id: Ie351809a781a6942e1e92d37068a5a56676a5c61

579|||description|||2011-06-22 07:40:02|||1000055|||Fix fontconfig usage in X11 font database  We should do FcConfigSubstitute(0, pattern, FcMatchFont) on a FcPattern for query because the family list in it will contain almost all the families after FcConfigSubstitute(0, pattern, FcMatchPattern), then the test in <match target="font"> will almost always succeed. In general, FcMatchFont substitute should only be done on the FcPattern that we got after FcFontMatch() or FcFontRenderPrepare().  Based on the suggestion of fontconfig author Behdad Esfahbod, this patch reorganized the tryPatternLoad logic so that it only does the QFontEngine creation part, FcPattern *match is retrieved outside of that function. In this way, the match pattern we got can be either from FcFontMatch() or after FcFontRenderPrepare() on one of the fonts we got from qt_fontSetForPattern(). Then we dont need to duplicate the pattern and add all criterias back with qt_addPatternProps(). It not only simplified the code a lot but also fix the way we apply FcMatchFont substitution. This substitution will either be done by FcFontMatch() or FcFontRenderPrepare, both implicitly.

Wrap it to about 72 characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the two together.  Further paragraphs come after blank lines.   - Bullet points are okay, too   - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a    single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here   - Use a hanging indent  Change-Id: Id5f9e256e7c856116dc607ab3c6b30391e81b438 Reviewed-by: John Doe Reviewed-by: Jane Doe Task-number: 13225235

644|||description|||2011-06-23 08:55:10|||1000063|||Automatically recover from some transient errors in test scripts  When running complex test procedures, it is unfortunately relatively common that certain types of errors may arise which are unrelated to the code under test.  One example of this is a test procedure which attempts to perform a git clone from a remote host.  If implemented simply, this test procedure will fail whenever the remote host is undergoing maintenance or a temporary network outage has occurred.  This is usually undesirable.  This commit adds some infrastructure for test scripts to transparently recover from these types of errors without having to explicitly code for them.  Currently handled are various errors from git, ssh and scp relating to network problems.  Task: QTQAINFRA-223 Change-Id: I8fb0a505cdbb8ad00f6bd036854b30e24201419b

657|||description|||2011-06-23 11:52:07|||1000044|||Add Qt::TimerType and the QTimer::timerType property  The timer type will control the accuracy of the timer. By default, all timers are CoarseTimers, which allows for +/- 5% interval adjustment. PreciseTimers will not have any interval adjustments, VeryCoarseTimers will have intervals adjusted to full second resolution.  Use QTimer::setTimerType() or the QTimer::singleShot() overload to specify the type.  QObject::startTimer() now takes a Qt::TimerType argument which defaults to Qt::CoarseTimer. QBasicTimer::startTimer() gets an overload that takes a Qt::TimerType argument. The argument is unused for now, since the QAbstractEventDispatcher interface needs to change (done in a separate commit).

659|||description|||2011-06-23 11:52:07|||1000044|||Add Qt::TimerType argument to QAbstractEventDispatcher::registerTimer()  ... and deprecate the old registerTimer() functions. The new pure- virtual registerTimer() breaks source-compatibility. Subclasses cannot be instantiated anymore, since the pure virtual function signature has changed.  QAbstractEventDispatcher::TimerInfo is no longer a QPair. It is now a struct with timerId, interval, and timerType members. This is a source incompatibility that should only affect subclasses of QAbstractEventDispatcher, which will need to pass 3 arguments to the TimerInfo constructor instead of 2. If the subclass used QPair<int,int> instead of the TimerInfo typedef, the QPair<int,int> declarations will need to be replaced with TimerInfo.  Call the new registerTimer() function with the type from QObject::startTimer(). Change all subclasses of QAbstractEventDispatcher to reimplement the new virtual function. The type argument is unused at the momemnt, except to ensure that registeredTimers() returns the type each timer was registered with. Implementations for the various dispatchers will be done in separate commits.  Author: Thiago Macieira <thiago.macieira@nokia.com> Change-Id: Ia22697e0ab0847810c5d162ef473e0e5a17a904b

662|||description|||2011-06-23 11:52:08|||1000044|||Use Qt::TimerType on UNIX when scheduling timers  As stated in the documentation for Qt::TimerType, we allow for up to 5% error for CoarseTimers (the default timer type). PreciseTimers are not adjusted at all, and VeryCoarseTimers fire with one-second accuracy. The objective is to make most timers wake up at the same time, thereby reducing CPU wakeups.  Note that this changes makes it possible for timers to fire early, which may be unexpected for some applications. Such applications should use PreciseTimers explicitly.

Theres no thread reusal or a thread pool (we need one thread running per subprocess being watched).  We really need instead the kernel to give us a file descriptor that does the job of this thread.  I dont like this solution, as its wasteful of resources. Im working on a solution that wont start the thread unless the stderr and stdout pipes close (if they were open in the first place) but the subprocess didnt exit. Those kinds of processes are rare and I would accept the resource usage.  Change-Id: I6f9b396e5b693adc97df225a9cb5e8763bec7a79

However this has shown to be too strict. Therefore, its now a bit relaxed (not as much as before): If the current item ends with the typed character we assume  this is intenional - general premature matches do not end with identifier characters anyway.  Note: Leaving only the last character as the condition is not an option since sometimes they are not shown in the proposal description.  This patch also lifts the text method to IAssistProposalItem since its reasonable the every proposal must have at least some description.  Change-Id: I2ef7de2b7f978ce7059cce50175137a03315f495

687|||description|||2011-06-23 16:15:03|||1000068|||Have the selection offer global handled always without delay.  In a previous attempt to solve the problem of selection offer globals arriving too early, the handling was delayed. This solved the issue of crashing but introduced a timing issue, because the offers (the mime types) will arrive immediately after the global and therefore will simply be ignored in case the delayed processing of the selection offer had not yet been done. The visibility of the problem depended on the implementation of the compositor, with recent changes to qt-compositor the issue is very visible.  The patch solves the issue properly: The wayland clipboard instance is created right away, as early when needed, and the integration will simply pick up the already created instance.

This is incorrect (eg. you can have many common names). In addition, some of the fields required by RFC3280 were not suppport. This change modifiers the API to return a list of entries of each type and adds support for the missing fields. It also updates the commonname matching code for SSL connections to handle multiple entries.  Change-Id: I9457266a205def0a07c13de47094ff56ead42845 Merge-request: 5

Normally, this is set up correctly by the init-repository script; however, we are changing the SHA1 of the qtdeclarative module _after_ we run init-repository, which means the state of the nested gitmodule becomes out of sync.  Fix it by always doing an extra submodule update whenever we change the SHA1 of any gitmodule.  Change-Id: I4252a8aae7885c5df5a86ddb328b17b55eb419bf

870|||description|||2011-06-29 08:12:38|||1000132|||Fix text color in some cases of QML and QStaticText  This reverts 518c2a58ed6fdfd7449cb4476aa8ea0d32ad16e3 which caused a regression.  When writing systems are mixed and an underline is set on the font, QPainter will set a pen with the current color and a new width on itself before drawing the decoration. This would cause the recorder in QStaticText to mark the pen as dirty, saving the current pen color in all subsequent text items. The effect was e.g. that in QML the cached color would override the current one, making it impossible to change the color on the text without forcing a relayout somehow.  The right fix is to only mark the pen as dirty when its color actually changes.  Task-number: QTBUG-20159 Change-Id: Ia819b67cccc9eaedd23fde655eab58cd892646f8 Reviewed-by: Jiang Jiang

875|||description|||2011-06-29 08:36:29|||1000132|||Fix text color in some cases of QML and QStaticText  This reverts 518c2a58ed6fdfd7449cb4476aa8ea0d32ad16e3 which caused a regression.  When writing systems are mixed and an underline is set on the font, QPainter will set a pen with the current color and a new width on itself before drawing the decoration. This would cause the recorder in QStaticText to mark the pen as dirty, saving the current pen color in all subsequent text items. The effect was e.g. that in QML the cached color would override the current one, making it impossible to change the color on the text without forcing a relayout somehow.  The right fix is to only mark the pen as dirty when its color actually changes.  Task-number: QTBUG-20159 Change-Id: I0db1966787f543695bcba4a0c13328ae0a17625b Reviewed-by: Jiang Jiang
